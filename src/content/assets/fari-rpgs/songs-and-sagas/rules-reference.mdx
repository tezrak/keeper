# The Tenth Realm

> The end was near, our time nearly up. But before the spill of blood, luminous doorways emerged amidst the vast sea. Guided by gods and spirits, our ancestors sailed through these radiant gates, into the unknown. Many perished, but some managed to survive and settle. Time passed. Now some of us are called to venture forth, to map these strange new lands. And one day, all shall hear the echoes of our destinies fulfilled as they ring out in songs and sagas.

# The Game

In this game, you perform **trial** and **fate rolls** when there is uncertainty in the fiction. You add cards to your hand when your **trial rolls** succeed, burn them to gain momentum, and, most importantly, continually collaborate in moving the story in interesting directions.

# Create your Character

### **1. Your Attributes**

Your **attributes** are the main way you interact with the world. Your character has **4 attributes**.

With your **strength**, you may crush, lift, strike and grapple.  With your **dexterity**, you may dash, aim, sneak and handle. With your **willpower**, you may perceive, solve, analyze and focus. With your **heart**, you may persuade, command, charm and honor.

To determine your starting modifiers, reveal a card for each **attribute**.

| Suit | Attribute Modifier        |
| ---- | ------------------------- |
| ♥   | Set your attribute to +2. |
| ♦   | Set your attribute to +1. |
| ♣   | Set your attribute to 0.  |
| ♠   | Set your attribute to -1. |

Write down the results on your character sheet.

> If you are unhappy with your **attributes**, you may try to get a better result by revealing another card, but must accept the new result. This can only be done for two attributes.

### **2. Your Guardian Spirit**

You are guarded by a **Vanori**, a spirit of the wild and messenger of the gods. The Vanori you choose increases certain **attributes**, sets your initial **max resilience**, and gives you a special **ability**.

> Additionally, you may burn a card to, for a short while, conjure your Vanori or take its physical appearance. Leverage its presence or your new form to roll with a reduced **DR**.

Choose, roll or invent a Vanori.

> 1. **BEAR**: Increase your **strength** by **2**  and your **heart** by **1**. Your **max resilience** is **d10+3**. You may burn a card to roll an extra d4 on top of your armor to resist incoming damage.

> 2. **WOLF**: Increase your **dexterity** by **2** and your **willpower** by **1**. Your **max resilience** is **d8+3**. You may burn a card to force an enemy to do a morale check.

> 3. **RAVEN**: Increase your **willpower** by **2** and your **dexterity** by **1**. Your **max resilience** is **d6+3**. You may burn a card to force an enemy to step down their damage die.

> 4. **ELK**: Increase your **heart** by **2** and your **strength** by **1**. Your **max resilience** is **d10+3**. When you burn a card to aid an ally, you give +3 to their score instead of the normal +2.

> 5. **OX**: Increase your **strength** by **2** and your **willpower** by **1**. Your **max resilience** is **d12+3**. You may burn a card during a short rest to get the benefits of a long rest.

> 6. **OWL**: Increase your **willpower** by **2** and your **heart** by **1**. Your **max resilience** is **d6+3**. Once per session, you may burn a card to mark XP twice.

> If you are unhappy with your **max resilience**, you may reroll once, but must accept the new result.

### **3. Your Armor And Weapon**

Your **armor** allows you to resist damage during **combat**. You start with a **d4** armor set. Fill the **d4 armor dot** on your character sheet.

Your **weapons** provide convenient ways to perform **attacks** on enemies. You start with a **d6 weapon** of your choice in your inventory.

# Chart the Map

These are strange new lands, filled with creatures of unfathomable forms, remnants of advanced yet long-lost civilizations, flora and fauna that are as beautiful as they are treacherous, and hopefully a place to call home.

Drop a **d20** on the **map sheet’s hex grid**, this is the region you are located in.

Now, and each time you enter a new hex, take the time, as a group, to describe the region. Use your imagination or jumpstart it with the provided rolling tables ([Songs and Sagas Rolling Tables](https://www.notion.so/Songs-and-Sagas-Rolling-Tables-5cf66254bc014af99b9d4243e0aee4e2?pvs=21) ). Write down key details in one of the numbered box and note the number in the appropriate hex. Finally, reveal a card to set the initial **risk rating** of the region.

| Suit | Risk Rating                         |
| ---- | ----------------------------------- |
| ♥   | Starts at 1 + a moment of serenity. |
| ♦   | Starts at 2 + an unexpected twist.  |
| ♣   | Starts at 2 + an impending threat.  |
| ♠   | Starts at 3 + an imminent danger.   |

The **risk rating** determines the level of unknown and danger in a region. The higher the rating, the more drama and unpredictability should be injected in the narrative. It typically ranges from **1 to 3**, but may step up or down at the GM’s discretion depending on your actions in the fiction.

> Each hex is 6 miles (or ~10 kilometers) face to face. A person can walk a hex in a day, a mount can cross two, a longship can row three but sail four with favorable winds.

# Trial Roll

When taking a risky action, make a **trial roll**.

1. Pick the **attribute** best suited for your action.
2. The GM discusses with the group and sets a **difficulty rating (DR)**, usually a **12**.
3. The GM reveals a number of cards matching the current region’s **risk rating**. For each **black card**, the **difficulty rating** of the roll is increased by **2**.
4. Roll a **d20** + the **attribute modifier** to get your **score**.

If your **score is greater than the difficulty rating**, it’s a **success**.

Otherwise you suffer a **setback**.

> **SUCCESS**: Gain control of a moment in the scene and narrate what happens next. Add one of the revealed cards to your hand if no cards were burned for the roll. You must pick a **red card** over a **black card**.
>
> **SETBACK**: Mark **XP**, but give up control of the narrative to the GM. They describe what happens and may inject more tension in the scene by introducing a new consequence (narrative mishap, loss of **resilience**, damaged **armor** or **weapon**, a new **condition**, etc).

| Rating | Descriptor  |
| ------ | ----------- |
| 9      | Easy        |
| 12     | Normal      |
| 15     | Challenging |

> _When a rule changes the **DR** of a roll, the group decide by how much, using the fiction as their guide._

# Fate Roll

When taking an action with an uncertain outcome but no consequential risks, make a **fate roll**: simply perform a **trial roll**, skipping step 3, and use the result to help guide the story forward.

> When making a fate roll, you also forego adding cards to your hand on a **success** and refrain from marking **XP** on a **setback**.

# Burning Cards

Burn a card from your hand to:

> **CALL THE GODS**: **+2** to your **score**.

> **AID AN ALLY**: **+2** to an ally’s **score**.

> **TURN THE TABLE**: Turn a **setback** into a **success**, but the GM gets to introduce a new **consequence**.

> **COME PREPARED**: Add an item to your inventory as if it had always been there. This may reduce the **DR** of a roll in certain situations, but the GM has the final say.

# Armor

Your **armor** allows you to resist incoming **damage** and is defined by a die rating (**d4** - **d6**). During an **enemy attack**, roll your **armor die** and subtract the result from the incoming **damage**. Armor may be ignored or damaged at the GM’s discretion. When damaged, the armor die is stepped down.

# Inventory

When you get an item or weapon, add it in an **inventory slot**.  Items can be used to reduce the **DR** of a roll, but the GM has the final say.

Weapons are assigned a die rating (**d4**- **d12**) and are used during  **attacks**.  Weapons may become damaged at the GM’s discretion. When damaged, the **weapon die** is stepped down. You may also take the time to repair damaged weapons when you take a **long rest**.

# Resilience & Conditions

Your **resilience** represents your physical and mental well-being. If reduced to **0**, make a **trial roll**.

> **SUCCESS**: You are not ready to fall, set your **resilience** at 1.
>
> **SETBACK**: You are incapacitated and close to death. If your wounds are tended, set your resilience at 1 but work with the GM to gain a new **condition**.

**Conditions** are negative aspects attached to your character. Each condition takes at least one **inventory slot**. To clear a condition, you need a **full rest** or wait until it becomes irrelevant. The GM can invoke conditions to increase the **DR** of a roll.

# Rest

To recover, you can:

> **SHORT**: Take half an hour to catch your breath. Reveal a card to recover **resilience**.

| Suit | Resilience                     |
| ---- | ------------------------------ |
| ♥   | Recover 5.                     |
| ♦   | Recover 3.                     |
| ♣   | Recover 2, trouble is ahead... |
| ♠   | Recover 1, trouble is here...  |

> **LONG**: Spend a couple of hours resting. Reveal a card and interpret the result as above, but **double the recovery**. You may spend this time fixing a damaged **weapon** or **armor**, but then only get the benefits of a **short rest**.

> **FULL**: Spend a week out of action or in calm transit to **restore all resilience** and, if it makes sense in the fiction, **clear a condition**.

# Reaction

When an NPC’s reaction to you is not obvious, reveal a card.

| Suit | Reaction           |
| ---- | ------------------ |
| ♥   | They seem helpful. |
| ♦   | They seem curious. |
| ♣   | They seem wary.    |
| ♠   | They seem hostile. |

# Combat

> **INITIATIVE**: To decide who goes first in combat, reveal a card.

| Suit | Initiative                  |
| ---- | --------------------------- |
| ♥♦ | Your group goes first.      |
| ♣♠ | The enemy group goes first. |

The group order stays the same until the combat is over.

> The individual order is not tracked; go with what makes the most sense or who’s most excited to play next.

The combat ends when all player characters or enemies run out of **resilience**, or if one side decides to withdraw (see Enemy Morale).

### Enemies

Enemies are made of **resilience**, **armor** and **weapons**, which work exactly like yours. You can build your own enemies or convert some from existing OSR bestiaries.

> Mobs of enemies may be grouped together as a single entity.

### During Your Turn

During a combat turn, choose one:

- Make a **trial roll** to attempt to reduce future **DRs**, to damage your target’s **armor**/**weapon**, or to otherwise alter the fiction.
- Perform an **attack**.

# Attack

To attack, choose between:

> **WEAPON**: When attacking with a weapon, the weapon’s die rating will serve as **damage die**.

> **FEAT**: When trying to harm an enemy through other means, the GM assigns a **damage die** to your action (**d4** - **d12**).

In both cases, make a **trial roll** (including card to hand or XP).

> **SUCCESS**: Use the **damage die** as is, or step it up if you rolled a **20**.
>
> **SETBACK**: Step down the **damage die** once, or twice if you rolled a **1**. The GM may inflict a **consequence** in addition to or in place of the stepped down damage die (e.g., a damaged weapon).

Roll the **damage die** and deal that much **damage** to your target’s **resilience**, minus their **armor die roll**. A damage die always ranges from a **d4** to a **d12**.

### During An Enemy’s Turn

Enemies **attack** and prompt you to defend with a **trial roll** (including card to hand or XP).

> **SUCCESS**: You avoid the attack, and the DR of your next roll is lowered if you rolled a 20.
>
> **SETBACK**: You get hit, the GM uses the enemy's damage die, stepped up if you rolled a 1. The GM may inflict a consequence in addition to or in place of the damage dealt to you (e.g., your armor is damaged, you gain a condition). The GM rolls the damage die and deals that much damage to your **resilience**, minus your **armor die roll**.

### Enemy Morale

When enemies feel outnumbered or see their leader fall, reveal a card to determine how they react.

| Suit | Morale                         |
| ---- | ------------------------------ |
| ♥   | They panic and try to flee.    |
| ♦   | They surrender or negotiate.   |
| ♣   | They stay in the fight.        |
| ♠   | They double down on the fight. |

# Experience

When a **trial roll** results in a **setback**, you get to **mark XP**, in which case you fill one of the eight boxes on your **XP track**.

When your XP track is filled, you receive a blessing from your Vanori: clear your **XP track** and do the following.

### Change Your Attributes

For each **attribute**, reveal a card.

| Suit | Modifier                      |
| ---- | ----------------------------- |
| ♥   | Increase the attribute by 2.  |
| ♦   | Increase the attribute by 1.  |
| ♣   | The attribute stays the same. |
| ♠   | You see a bad omen.           |

> _If you reveal more than one_ ♠*, the omen becomes more menacing.*

### Change Your Resilience

To get your new **max resilience**, reveal a card.

| Suit | Modifier                        |
| ---- | ------------------------------- |
| ♥   | Increase max resilience by 2.   |
| ♦   | Increase max resilience by 1.   |
| ♣   | Your resilience stays the same. |
| ♠   | Your Vanori shows you a vision. |

# Oracle

If you seek answers to questions where your character isn't directly involved in the outcome, formulate a yes/no question and evaluate the likelihood of a positive outcome.

Then, **reveal 1 card** for sheer luck, and **reveal one card for each** additional factor or **advantage** that would increase the likelihood of a positive outcome.

- If you have revealed at least **2 red cards**, the answer to your question is a **strong yes**.
- If you have revealed **1 red card**, the answer to your question is a **weak yes**.
- If you have revealed **no red** cards, the answer to your question is **no**.

Use this answer as a jumping point for your story or continue asking questions until you feel ready to continue playing.
