# AfterGlow

_It started when a WIZARD cleaved apart the temple into two._

_Because, in the cyclical way of things, one ideology eventually wins out over the other. The Celestial Cycles shatter and pour away, blending into the colour of their worship into tones of soft purple and creamy orange hues._

_Now there is no more day or night, no rising or setting of the Godly tombs that float in carefully calculated arches through the sky: there is only the AfterGlow and the wake of a different world._

AfterGlow is a solo or co-operative play journaling TTRPG game. Become a Dawncarver Acolyte of the Light, Imefelga, or a Nightweaver Acolyte of the God of the Night, Elestrell.

Expand the world as you explore, search for offerings, fight dangerous threats and discover the mysteries of the Wizard and the AfterGlow.

Play co-operatively or competitively to see whether balance can be achieved or destroyed, with your God's energies reigning supreme over the world.

## To play, you will need the following:

- A notebook to keep a record of your story as it progresses.
- A standard deck of playing cards.
- Two D6s.
- A sheet of paper, to act as a map for you to track your explored locations.

AfterGlow is a 32 page PDF that includes character sheets.
